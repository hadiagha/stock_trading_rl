# stock_trading_rl
In this project, by using linear model, I have build an RL model to do trading for three stock index names: 'AAPL','MSI','SBUX'

The source for this tutorial is: Udemy.Artificial.Intelligence.Reinforcement.Learning
I am going to extend this model to other RL models and add more options on trading mechanism.
